  Perks -
  1. Convenience: Obviously if I already have a phone in my pocket, it’s simple to start using it right away without carrying a pen along with paper. This simplifies everything.
  2. Searching: Something that’s hard to do with paper? Searching for what you wrote down. You can look back at it, but if you want to keep it for any amount of time, you must retype and save it. With an amazing note taking app, you don’t have to do this. If you remember a random idea, you can search back through all of your notes to find it. Note taking apps make it simple to keep up with your information.
  3. Accessibility: Beyond the convenience in your pocket, most note taking apps also provide remarkable accessibility. You can add, copy and edit your notes from a laptop, tablet or phone. This helps you transfer notes to work accounts or easily share them with friends.
